The irreversible illness-death model describes the pathway from an
initial state to an absorbing state either directly or through an
intermediate state. This model is frequently used in medical
applications where the intermediate state represents illness and the
absorbing state represents death. In many studies, disease onset times
are not known exactly. This happens for example if the disease status
of a patient can only be assessed at regular visits. In this situation
the disease onset times are interval-censored. This article presents
the \pkg{SmoothHazard} package for \proglang{R}. It implements
algorithms for simultaneously fitting regression models to the three
transition intensities of an illness-death model where the transition
times to the intermediate state may be interval-censored and the all
event times can be right censored. The program parses the individual
data structure of the subjects in a data set to find the individual
contributions to the likelihood. The three baseline hazard functions
are modelled by Weibull distributions, alternatively in a
semi-parametric approach by an M-spline approach. For a given set of
covariates, the estimated transition intensities can be combined into
predictions of cumulative event probabilities and life expectancies.
