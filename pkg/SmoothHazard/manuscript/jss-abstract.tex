The irreversible illness-death model describes the pathway from an
initial state to a absorbing state either directly or through an
intermediate state. This model is frequently used in medical
applications where the intermediate state represents illness and the
absorbing state represents death. In many studies, disease onset times
are not known exactly. This happens for example if the disease status
of a patient can only be assessed at regular visits. In this situation
the disease onset times are interval-censored. This article presents
the \pkg{SmoothHazard} package for \proglang{R}. It implements
algorithms for simultaneously fitting regression models to the three
transition intensities of an illness-death model where the transition
times to the intermediate state may be interval-censored and the all
event times can be right censored. The program parses the data
structure to find the corresponding contribution to the likelihood.
The three baseline hazard functions are modelled by Weibull
distributions, or by M-splines. For a given set of covariates, the
estimated transition intensities can be combined into predictions of
cumulative event probabilities and life expectancies.
