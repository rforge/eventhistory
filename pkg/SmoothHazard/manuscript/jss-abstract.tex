The irreversible illness-death model allows subjects to move from an
initial state (``health state'') to a terminal state (``death state'')
either directly or through an intermediate state (``disease
state''). Disease onset times may not be known exactly, for example if
the disease status of a patient can only be assessed at regular
visits. In this situation the disease onset times are usually
interval-censored. This article presents the \pkg{SmoothHazard}
package for \proglang{R}. It implements algorithms for simultaneously
fitting regression models to the three transition intensities of an
illness-death model where the times to the intermediate state may be
interval-censored data. The three baseline hazard functions are either
parametrized according to Weibull distributions or approximated by
M-splines. For a given set of covariates, the intensities models can
be combined into predictions of cumulative event probabilities and
life expectancies.
