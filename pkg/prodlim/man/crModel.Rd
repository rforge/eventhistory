\usage{
crModel()
}
\value{
A structural equation model initialized with four
variables: the latent event times of two causes, the latent
right censored time, and the observed right censored event
time.
}
\description{
Competing risks model for simulation
}
\details{
Create a competing risks model with to causes to simulate a
right censored event time data without covariates

This function requires the \code{lava} package.
